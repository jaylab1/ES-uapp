                <p>In order to operate the ESERVISS Platform and to provide You with information about products or services that may be of interest to You, We may collect “personal information” (i.e. information that could be used to contact You directly (without using the ESERVISS Platform) such as full name, postal address, phone number, credit/debit card information, or email address) or “demographic information” (i.e. information that You submit, or that We collect, that is not personal information; this may include, but is not limited to, hometown, gender, username, age/birth date, browsing history information, searching history information, and registration history information). We will also collect the contact information of Your friends, if You choose to connect Your contacts and address book information with ESERVISS and Your login credentials to Your social network accounts, such as Facebook and Twitter, if You choose to connect those accounts with your ESERVISS account. You represent and warrant that You have the authority to provide Us with any such contact information. Demographic information is divided into two categories:</p>

                How We Use Personal Information

            <div class="item item-body">
                <p>We use Your email address and Your other personal information to help Us efficiently operate the ESERVISS Platform, to contact You in connection with Your transactions and other activities on the ESERVISS Platform (including, but not limited to, confirmation emails, or important news that could affect Your relationship with ESERVISS), to forward trip information to You from other Users, to forward trip information from You to other Users, and to contact You and others to suggest potential matches. We use Your contact information to find and connect with Your friends (when instructed by You). These types of communications are known as “Operational Communications.” In some cases, Operational Communications may also contain commercial messages, such as banner ads and special offers.</p>
                <h2>To operate the ESERVISS Platform</h2>
                <p> including processing Your transactions and supporting Your activities on the ESERVISS Platform. By purchasing, or registering or making reservations for, products or services offered or sponsored by third parties on the ESERVISS Platform, or electing to receive communications (such as emails or material by mail) or electing to participate in contests, sweepstakes or other programs (such as discount or rewards programs), offered or sponsored by third parties on the ESERVISS Platform, You consent to Our providing Your personal information to those third parties. Those third parties may use Your personal information in accordance with their own privacy policies. You will need to contact those third parties to instruct them directly regarding Your preferences for the use of Your personal information by them. Additionally, You agree that We may use and disclose all such information so submitted to such third parties in the same manner in which We are entitled to use and disclose any other information You submit to Us.</p>

                How We Use Demographic Data
            </div>
            <div class="item item-body">
                <h2>We may review all demographic Data</h2>
                <p>We may use public information to enable other users to search Your profile, to determine whether Your trip details fit other user's requirements, and to communicate with You. We may use demographic information to tailor the ESERVISS Platform and communications to Your interests. We may also share demographic information with advertisers on an anonymous and aggregated basis (i.e., without telling the advertisers Your identity). One of the reasons We may do this is to increase the likelihood that Our advertisers' goods and services will appeal to You as a user of the ESERVISS Platform. Our sharing of demographic information with advertisers is anonymous (i.e., We do not tell advertisers which particular ESERVISS Users are members of which demographic groups), subject to the rest of this privacy policy. When You respond to an advertisement, however, We ask You to remember that if that ad that is targeted to a demographic group and You decide to give the advertiser Your personal information, then the advertiser may be able to identify You as being a member of that demographic group.</p>
